# üìù Snaccs

A **snacc** is a short-form, expressive post made up of text, a GIF, or both. Users post snaccs to share thoughts, vibes, or reactions directly on their profile. They're social, snack-sized, and meant to reflect the user's personality or mood.

## üí° What is a Snacc?

A snacc is:
- A **short message**, a **GIF**, or a combination of both
- Posted to a user‚Äôs public profile
- **Reactable** with emoji reactions
- **Permanent** until deleted by the user (not ephemeral like Snacc Board posts)

## üåê GIPHY Integration

- Users search for and select GIFs using the **GIPHY API** within the snacc creation screen
- The selected GIF‚Äôs URL is stored in the `gif_url` field
- We may cache metadata (e.g. `gif_id`, `source`) for analytics or deduplication
- GIFs are embedded using the original GIPHY-hosted URL ‚Äî no need for Supabase Storage

## üîê Visibility Options

| Visibility      | Who Can See                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `public`         | Anyone can see the snacc on the user's profile                  |
| `followers`      | Only visible to users who follow the poster                     |

Users choose visibility at the time of posting. It can be changed only by deleting and reposting.

---

## üòÑ Emoji Reactions

Each snacc supports **emoji reactions**, but users can react with **only one emoji per snacc**.  
Selecting a new emoji replaces the old one. Reactions are public and displayed beneath the snacc.

See [`snacc-reactions.md`](./snacc-reactions.md) for full details.
