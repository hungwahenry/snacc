# üë§ User Profile

Each user on snacc has a customizable profile that showcases their personality, interests, and activity on the app. Profiles are central to how users discover each other, connect, and interact beyond random video calls.

## üß† Snacc Board

The Snacc Board is like a "story" feed on a user's profile:

- Text-based only (no media)
- Disappears automatically after 24 hours
- One active board entry per user at any time
- Viewable by anyone unless the user is blocked

## üõ† Backend Notes

- All profile-related data lives in the `profiles` table.
- The `users` table is managed by **Supabase Auth** and contains core user identity info: email, UID, etc.
- Profile picture URLs are stored in `profiles.snacc_pic`, referencing files in Supabase Storage.
- Follows, reactions, snaccs, and call stats are stored in related tables and reference the user‚Äôs UID.
- All sensitive updates (like changing username or profile picture) are protected with Supabase **Row-Level Security (RLS)**.
