## 🔑 What is snacc?

snacc is a social app where users connect instantly with others through random video calls. Every call is a chance to meet someone new, vibe, and possibly make a friend. The app lets users express themselves through “snaccs” — short text thoughts and GIFs posted to their profiles — while building connections through likes, follows, and direct messages.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📹 Random Video Calling**  
  Instantly connect with random users in real-time video chats. Swipe into a new face, vibe, or convo — just like flipping channels on a social TV.

- **💖 Heart Reactions**  
  During calls, users can "heart" each other. Hearts increase a user's social score and indicate interest or appreciation.

- **👥 Profiles & Follows**  
  Each user has a profile with a display name, profile picture (snacc pic), a short bio (snacc liner), and posts. Users can follow or unfollow others, and mutual follows unlock direct messaging.

- **📝 Snaccs**  
  Short-form posts made up of text or GIFs. Snaccs can be public or followers-only, and other users can react to them using emojis.

- **🧠 Snacc Board**  
  A place to drop quick thoughts or feelings — like a story, but text-based. Posts here disappear after 24 hours.

- **📨 DMs (Mutual Followers Only)**  
  Once two users follow each other, they can chat privately.

- **🔎 Discovery Filters**  
  Users can customize who they connect with based on shared language, interests, age, gender, and location preferences.

- **🎭 Customization**  
  Users can update their username, snacc pic, snacc liner, and more to reflect their identity and personality.

- **🛡️ Safety Tools**  
  Users can block or remove followers, giving them control over who can interact with them.
